# The sysctl swappiness parameter determines the kernel's preference for pushing anonymous pages or page cache to disk in memory-starved situations.

# and a value of 100 means IO cost is assumed to be equal.

# The value controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the memory which is used for caching of directory and inode objects (VFS cache).
# Lowering it from the default value of 100 makes the kernel less inclined to reclaim VFS cache (do not set it to 0, this may produce out-of-memory conditions)
